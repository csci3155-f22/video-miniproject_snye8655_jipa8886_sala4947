# TODO: React Tic Tac Toe game by Sneha Yendluri, Jisoo Park and Sami Lamichhane

## Description

We were all excited to learn React by doing this mini tic tac toe game. To give you a little bit of context React is one of the leading JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React allows developers to create reusable UI components, which makes it easier to build complex and dynamic applications. It also uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to optimize updates and improve performance. Another main advantage of React is that it is easier for testing and debugging components. 

The main goal of this project was to identify the similar concepts that are used in both scala and react by implementing a fun game called Tic-tac-toe. We start the video off by explaining the concepts like callbacks, higher order functions and abstract syntax structure which are similar to the Scala language. We then go on to the tic tac toe code to see how these concepts are executed in react. During this demo the users can also see that it updates automatically through live streaming data. 

We continue to talk about the differences that we found in Scala and React. ??????



## Repository Organization

In this repository, we created a folder called tic-tac-toe-react. We worked on this folder before adding it to the git repository that's why you can also see one git commit. But in this folder, you can navigate to src which has all the main files that we worked on. In this src folder, it is divided into javascript files and respective css files in the css folder. 

We added our script.pdf file that gives a little bit of context and explains the project in detail. Our slides are in TicTacToeMiniProject.pdf 


## Building and Testing Instructions

To Build React, download node.js to your mac or pc. Then run the command 

### `sudo npm install -g tic-tac-toe-react`

This will create a react app with this name "tic-tac-toe-react". Then open it in vs code to edit the code and files.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
